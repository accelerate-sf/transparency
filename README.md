# Enhancing transparency of elected officials

San Francisco's democratic process thrives on transparency and accountability. It is imperative that voters have access to up-to-date information regarding their elected officialsâ€™ actions, including but not limited to voting records, decisions, and regulations passed. This would not only allow for greater oversight but also ensure that officials are held to account.

The majority of voters lack the time or resources to access and analyze raw data directly from government databases. As such, there's a growing need for an automated system that can gather, process, and present these data in a clear, concise, and user-friendly manner.

## The Challenge

To develop a platform that provides real-time insights into the actions of elected officials in San Francisco. This platform should be capable of:

Automatically pulling data from relevant government websites concerning assembly meetings, votes, decisions, and regulations.
Leveraging advanced algorithms, such as large language models, to digest and summarize the data, making it accessible and understandable for the general public.
Presenting the information via a user-friendly interface, ensuring ease of access and navigation for all users, regardless of their technological proficiency.
Ensuring data accuracy, relevancy, and timeliness, allowing voters to make informed decisions and hold their representatives accountable.

### Some guiding questions to consider

- How can we ensure the real-time accuracy of the data being pulled from government websites?
- What features would make the data more digestible and relatable for users?
- How can we structure the platform to promote regular engagement and repeated visits by the public?
- How can potential biases in data interpretation and presentation be mitigated?

### Expected Outcomes

The platform will provide real-time access to elected officials' actions in San Francisco in a straightforward interface. Users will find up-to-date data, which is easy to understand, leading to better-informed decisions about their representatives. The system should adapt and improve based on user feedback, ensuring ongoing accuracy and relevance

### Datasets

All data pertaining to assembly meetings, votes, decisions, and regulations passed by elected officials are publicly available. Developers are encouraged to source datasets directly from the appropriate San Francisco government websites. Due diligence must be exercised to ensure that the data used is current, accurate, and comprehensive.
